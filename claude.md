# Kinetic AI Website

This is the official marketing website for Kinetic AI, an autonomous physical-layer defense platform that transforms hardware nodes into 24/7 senior-level penetration testers using Claude 4.5 Sonnet. The site follows a black & white minimalist aesthetic inspired by Veria Labs, featuring an inverted floral pattern background that creates a sophisticated, professional look. The website showcases the company's proven track record of successfully auditing billion-dollar companies including ElevenLabs ($6.6B valuation) and 10+ Y Combinator startups, positioning Kinetic AI as a B2B security solution with the ultimate vision of becoming the autonomous immune system for U.S. Department of Defense networks (the "Ares Edition"). The site includes a hero section, scrolling company marquee, proof-of-work statistics, an alternating left-right process flow explaining how the system works (Connect → Find → Collaborate → Monitor), capability highlights, founder credentials, the Ares roadmap vision, and a call-to-action section with a night landscape background. Key features include autonomous reconnaissance, active countermeasures (Wi-Fi de-authentication), honeypot deployment, and human-in-the-loop collaborative intelligence for complex security barriers. The website is backed by ElevenLabs Grants and built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations.
